<h2 id="february-1-2018">1.12.11 (February 1, 2018)</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: We&#39;ve identified an issue with Self-Service interactive and UAC - we are working on a fix. Please see <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/36">#36</a> and subscribe for details.</p>
<p>A few nice things going into this release with Package Reducer/Optimize coming out of preview, Package Internalizer allowing you to specify variable overrides</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes">BREAKING CHANGES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Package Reducer is now on by default</li>
</ul>
<p>When we first released package reducer, it was in a preview mode to allow for folks to opt in to test it and find issues. Now we are turning it on by default. If you should experience issues with it, please contact support to file an issue (provide a zipped log as well). To turn it off should you not want to use it, you can just run <code>choco feature disable --name=reduceInstalledPackageSpaceUsage</code>.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes-1">BUG FIXES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Self-Service / Background Mode:<br />
* Fix - Work with empty sessions. Self-service users were incorrectly bypassing background service when their active session doesn&#39;t have a name, which has become common with Windows 10.<br />
* Fix - Allow self-service to work when the current working directory is different from system drive or a mapped drive. Also allow it to be set to locations where any user would not have a permissions error.</li>
<li>Package Internalizer (Choco Download):<br />
* Fix - When a variable is set to the contents of a file, work with that appropriately. A good example of this is <code>$data</code> variable in <a href="https://github.com/dotnetcore-chocolatey/dotnetcore-chocolateypackages/blob/d5960c11dda388cc7f7ab6438eee8984774f7662/dotnetcore-runtime.install/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1#L4">dotnetcore-runtime</a> package.<br />
* Fix - Allow setting variable when there is a comment on the same line following the set. An example of this is in the <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/blob/91f4e51f5c8503ca962c22a2f087b96d22ae0e9f/automatic/firefox/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L26">Firefox</a> package.</li>
<li>Package Builder (Choco New):<br />
* Fix - Package Builder UI should recognize Architect and MSP editions and correctly set the UI for use with them.<br />
* Fix - Extract icon from the proper location for the file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improvements-1">IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Package Internalizer (Choco Download):<br />
* Override variables in the installation script. When you see something like <code>$locale</code> being set and you want to override it to your own value for internalization, you can pass that variable name and value as a key value pair. As an example, try <code>choco download thunderbird --internalize locale=en-US</code> versus <code>choco download thunderbird --internalize locale=es-ES</code>.</li>
<li>Package Reducer - <code>choco optimize</code> command out of preview.</li>
<li>Package Builder (Choco New):<br />
* Extract icons from MSIs as well.<br />
* Package Builder UI logo animzation should match chocolatey website.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="december-18-2017">1.12.10 (December 18, 2017)</h2>
<h3 id="features-1">FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run background service interactively - sometimes you install applications that are unattended but cannot be silent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want self-service to interactively manage installations, run <code>choco feature enable --name=useBackgroundServiceInteractively</code>. This requires that you use the <code>ChocolateyLocalAdmin</code> account with the Chocolatey-managed password as passwords are not stored and the service would need to produce that at runtime. There are some security considerations and why this is not turned on by default. Please see <a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-agent-service#interactive-self-service-consideration">interactive self-service consideration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="july-10-2017">1.12.0 (July 10, 2017)</h2>
<h3 id="features-3">FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Package Reducer / Optimize (All licensed editions) - Reduce Space Usage for Chocolatey Installations</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">If you have a significant number of Chocolatey packages you manage, you may notice that you also may have a pretty significant space usage under the Chocolatey lib directory. Package reducer automatically decreases the size of nupkg files to around 5KB and removes installers and zips automatically from your package install directories. This may allow you to save GBs of usage for a large amount of packages being managed.

To learn more about Package Reducer and `choco optimize`, please see https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-package-reducer.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Package Audit (C4B) - Learn Who and When</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">Reporting is very important, and auditing not only when your installations occurred but who installed them can be critical. There is nothing that presents this kind of information as easily as you will be able to gather it with Chocolatey for Business (C4B) and Package Audit.

To learn more about Package Audit, please see https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-package-audit.</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improvements-9">IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Package Internalizer (Choco Download):<br />
* Option (<code>--internalize-all-urls</code>) to internalize any url in a package (not just if the package scripts contain known-compatible known functions).</li>

<li>Windows Service Management Functions:<br />
* Added <code>useLocalSystemForServiceInstalls</code> feature switch to disable using LocalSystem as the user for services by default.<br />
* Added config settings to provide local user / password.<br />
* If the password is empty or not provided, Chocolatey will manage the password securely.<br />
* If the user doesn&#39;t exist, the account will be created<br />
* Accounts are ensured to be administrators<br />
* Accounts are ensured to have Log on as service and batch rights.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="june-27-2017">1.11.0 (June 27, 2017)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Self-Service / Background Mode<br />
* Fix - Use a URI with WCF named pipes that doesn&#39;t exclusively hold a lock on the root (blocking other services). Fallback to old URI for versions of chocolatey-agent less than 0.7.0+. - see <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/12">#12</a>.<br />
* Fix - Ensure chocolatey.lib can send arguments through and not just choco.exe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improvements-10">IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Package Synchronizer - update registry links when software updates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="june-9-2017">1.10.0 (June 9, 2017)</h2>
<p>This release brings Package Throttle, Package Synchronizer&#39;s &quot;Show All Packages in Programs and Features&quot;, and Direct Installer (aka Package-less Install) to Chocolatey. There are also numerous improvements to Package Builder, fixes and improvements to Package Internalizer and Self-Service. Package Throttle is in all licensed editions, allowing Pro, MSP, and C4B customers the ability to slow down Chocolatey as it downloads packages and any resources the packages are downloading. See more details each section below.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-1">BREAKING CHANGES</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[Security] Self-Service / Background Mode - support background mode with self-service sources only by default</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">If you are using self-service functionality, when you upgrade to v1.10, you will need to go to those sources that you allow to be self-service and ensure they are selected to allow self-service (`choco source list`). Otherwise by default users are going to be locked out of using those sources. The move to opt-in is best from a security standpoint and we want to give you the ability to have folks opt-in to the better behavior.

To change this behavior back to the way it was previously, simply run `choco disable -n useBackgroundServiceWithSelfServiceSourcesOnly`. For more details see `choco feature list` or https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-configuration#self-service-background-mode</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="features-4">FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Package Throttle - Throttle Bandwidth / Rate Limit Download Speeds</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">By default, Chocolatey downloads packages and resources as fast as it can. Package Throttle gives you a way to slow down Chocolatey so it doesn&#39;t overwhelm any bandwidth restrictions you may have. This is done as both a setting and per package install/upgrade. This is in bits per second (not bytes, bits is what most network traffic is measured in). When adding at runtime, simply add `--bps=VALUE`. To set the value in the configuration, call `choco config set maximumDownloadRateBitsPerSecond VALUE`. For more details see https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-package-reducer.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Package Synchronizer&#39;s Show All Packages In Programs and Features</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">This means packages that do not have an underlying installation can still show up in Programs and Features and be managed there as well, which allows for legacy inventory reporting systems to see all the software that is installed in the same way that Chocolatey is able to. A picture can probably best explain this feature, check out [All Package In Programs and Features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/choco-wiki/e619d5d25018f9362d50749ee86554ebc4f4f04d/images/features/features_packages_in_programs_and_features.png)

To turn this feature on, simply run the following command `choco feature enable -n showAllPackagesInProgramsAndFeatures`. For more details on the feature, see https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-configuration#package-synchronizer and https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-synchronize. This does require one additional run of `choco` to take affect (same when disabling the feature), hopefully we can remove that in the future.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Package-less Install / Direct Installer - Install and upgrade directly from installers (MSIs, EXEs, etc)!</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">If Package Builder can create a fully unattended package for an installer, you don&#39;t even need a package first. You can simply call `choco install nameoffile.msi` or `choco upgrade nameoffile.exe` and Chocolatey will generate packaging on the fly and install/upgrade the package!</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug-fixes-13">BUG FIXES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix - choco new generates uninstall template with wrong use of registry key variable - see <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1304">#1304</a></li>

<p>Package Builder has some major improvements in this release, including a new UI! See <a href="https://chocolatey.org/blog/package-builder-announcements" class="uri">https://chocolatey.org/blog/package-builder-announcements</a> for details! While building some of the features for the enhancements for this release, we&#39;ve made quite a few tweaks and fixes to Package Builder and we think you are going to like the results. Being able to generate packages from the installed software on a reference system is huge (<code>choco new --from-programs-and-features</code>)!</p>
<p>Pro users now have the ability to download packages (minus internalization). This is fantastic if you want to pull down a lot of packages quickly from a remote source. Or pull down packages and push them up to an internal source.</p>
<h3 id="features-8">FEATURES</h3>

<li>Package Downloader comes to Pro+ Licenses - minus internalizer, you can now download a package using an easy command <code>choco download</code>.</li>

* Fix - mixed line endings were causing &quot;Index was outside the bounds of the array&quot; errors.</li>
<li>Package Synchronizer:<br />
* Fix - sync location should not be in the extensions folder, causes extension loading issues - a similar fix will be in open source to ignore the old sync location in v0.10.4 (see <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1041">#1041</a>).<br />
* Fix - sync over an existing synced package without error.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improvements-20">IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
